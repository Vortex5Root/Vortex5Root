## About Me

I am a passionate software developer with over a decade of experience across various programming languages and fields. My coding journey began in 2013 with Java, creating Minecraft plugins such as plot, crate, and minigame plugins. Over the years, I have expanded my expertise into cybersecurity, reverse engineering, web vulnerabilities, artificial intelligence, and blockchain development.

### Highlights of My Journey:
- **2014-2017**: Explored cybersecurity, reverse engineering, and web vulnerabilities, mastering C#, C++, Python, and Perl.
- **2018**: Developed a GPT bot for an AI project related to POGO, sparking my interest in artificial intelligence.
- **2019**: Focused on networking database libraries, discovering three undisclosed 0-day exploits in PHP, Teamspeak3, and networking protocols.
- **2020**: Advanced Python networking skills, blockchain core development, and created a remake of phpMyAdmin.
- **2021**: Designed "Hoax," a new network protocol, and enhanced my hacking skills.
- **2022**: Completed freelance projects, including Telegram bots and web pages.
- **2023**: Joined the Champalimaud Center For the Unknown, contributing to the Svaeva AI project, which integrates multiple AI systems into a single API.
- **2024**: Worked on METAMERSION, developing a phone that enables voice interaction with large language models (LLMs).
- **2025**: Collaborated with the "ML Core" laboratory to reverse engineer OptiTrack, Dante Sound System, and VC-A7IP_A71PN cameras, creating Python SDKs for AI integration with professional audio systems, cameras, and VR headsets.

Despite challenges, my passion for coding drives me to continuously explore new technologies and innovate. Let's connect and create something extraordinary together!

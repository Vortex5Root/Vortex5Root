# Welcome to My Profile

## Introduction

As a 'professional' coder with over 10 years of experience, I have a diverse background in programming languages and fields. Beginning in 2013, I started creating Minecraft plugins including plot, crate, and minigame plugins in Java. In 2014, I developed a strong interest in cybersecurity, specifically in networking protocols, exploiting, and reverse engineering, and began learning C# and C++. I continued exploring this field by studying web vulnerabilities and learning Python and Perl in 2017.

- In 2018, I worked on an AI project to POGO, developing a trading bot, and started to become interested in AI. I also began working on an application called TukTukAPP, which unfortunately experienced team troubles.
 
- In 2019, I developed networking database libraries and worked with sockets and protocols, discovering three 0-day exploits that were never released to the public on PHP, Teamspeak3, and networking.

- In 2020, I began developing networking skills in Python using libraries such as struct, scapy, and sockets, as well as blockchain core development knowledge. I also created a remake of phpMyAdmin. 

- In 2021, I furthered my hacking skills and started a big project called Hoax, which included sending a 0-day exploit to Fujitsu. In 2022,
I worked on several freelance projects including Telegram selling bots and web pages, and secured an investment for Hoax.

Project on Hold, in 2023, the team for Hoax was dismissed. Despite this setback, I continue to be passionate about coding and am always exploring new technologies and projects to work on.
